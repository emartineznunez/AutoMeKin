# üöÄQuick Start 


If you're eager to experience it firsthand, you can try this Notebook:    


[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/emartineznunez/AutoMeKin/blob/main/notebooks/AutoMeKin.ipynb)

# Installation of AutoMeKin
**AutoMeKin** offers four different installation and deployment methods: 
1. [Build with `micromamba` $\scriptstyle($recommended option$\scriptstyle)$](#mm)
2. [Build from source](#build)
3. [Singularity container](#singularity)

## 1. Build with `micromamba` <a name="mm"></a>
This is the recommended option. The packages `git` and `curl` must be installed beforehand.

First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/emartineznunez/AutoMeKin.git
```

Go to the AutoMeKin directory:

```
cd AutoMeKin
```

To build `AutoMeKin` and its dependencies (including [`amk_tools`](https://github.com/dgarayr/amk_tools), `qcore` and `molden`) within a `micromamba` environment named `amk_env`, just type:

```
bash Build_micromamba.sh
```

{: .highlight }    
`Build_micromamba.sh` should be executed only when installing a new version or when using the code for the first time.   
After successfully creating the environment, you must activate it and load the `AutoMeKin` module. These four instructions will be displayed once the build process is complete. For your convenience, you can copy these sentences into a script or file.

Before using `qcore` for the first time, remember to agree to the Software License Agreement and to set your token by running:

```
entos --license
```




## 2. Build from source <a name="build"></a>

The most recent version is available at GitHub and can be installed as indicated in this section.

You can build, system-wide and including dependencies, following the steps indicated in these scripts: 
- [CentOS-based script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emartineznunez/AutoMeKin/main/Build_Centos.sh)
- [Ubuntu-based script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emartineznunez/AutoMeKin/main/Build_Ubuntu.sh)


To install everything manually, follow the next steps.

### Installing dependencies 

{: .highlight }    
The following **packages** are required beforehand:   
[GNU Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/), [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [GNU bc](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/), [environment-modules](https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules), [GNU Awk, gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/), [GNU C Compiler, gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [GNU Fortran Compiler, gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran), [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/GNU-Parallel.html), [SQLite\>= 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)   
The installation of [molden](https://www.theochem.ru.nl/molden/linux.html) is highly recommended to analyze the results.

Additionally,

{: .highlight }    
The following **Python3 libraries** are
needed:  
[ASE>= 3.21.1](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html), [Matplotlib>= 3.3.4](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html), [NetworkX>= 2.5](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html), [NumPy>= 1.19.5](https://numpy.org/install/), [SciPy>= 1.5.4](https://scipy.org/install/), [amk_tools](https://github.com/dgarayr/amk_tools)


### Installing AutoMeKin

Once the above packages are installed, you can now install AutoMeKin
following these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emartineznunez/AutoMeKin.git
```
```bash
cd AutoMeKin
```
```bash
autoreconf -i
```
```bash
./configure --prefix=path_to_program
```
Where you can specify where you want to install it, _e.g._, `/opt/AutoMeKin`{: .language-bash .highlight}
```bash
make 
```
```bash
make install
```
For convenience, and once ‚ÄúEnvironment Modules‚Äù has been installed, you
should add the following line to your `.bashrc` file:
```bash
module use path_to_program/modules
```
where `path_to_program` is the path where you installed amk (_e.g._,
`$HOME/amk-2021`{: .language-bash .highlight}).

## 3. Singularity container <a name="singularity"></a>
If singularity is already installed in your
computer, you can obtain the container from sylabs. First check the
latest image, Tag, by typing: 

```bash
singularity search automekin
```

and replace `<Tag>` below by that number.
Then, from your `$HOME` type: 

```bash
singularity pull library://emartineznunez/default/automekin:<Tag>
```

You can start an instance of the container and run it using:

```bash
singularity instance start automekin_<Tag>.sif automekin
```
```bash
singularity run instance://automekin
```

which will allow you to run low-level scripts. You can stop the instance
using:

```bash
singularity instance stop automekin
```

Note, however, that if you want to use G09/G16 you must bind it to the
container. To help you do so, we created the scripts `SingularitygXX.sh`
(replace `XX` with 09 or 16), which can be downloaded as:
```bash
curl -LJO https://github.com/emartineznunez/Singularity_amk/raw/main/SingularitygXX.sh
```
The script should be run with the complete path to the sif file as
argument as in the example:
```bash
SingularitygXX.sh $HOME/automekin_<Tag>.sif
```
Note that `SingularitygXX.sh` will start a new instance of the container
every time it is executed. To list the instances use:
```bash
singularity instance list
```
And stop them as indicated above.

### Installing other electronic structure packages

While mopac comes with the distribution, [gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) and/or [Entos Qcore](https://software.entos.ai/qcore/documentation/) should be installed by the user.

{: .highlight }   
Entos Qcore, which is free for academia, can be easily installed following these steps:

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)
2. Add the following line to `$HOME/.condarc`{: .language-bash .highlight}, creating the file if not present:
```bash
auto_activate_base: false
```
which avoids activation of base environment.   
3. Install qcore version 0.8.14 in the conda environment qcore-0.8.14-env:
```bash
conda create -n qcore-0.8.14-env -c entos -c conda-forge qcore==0.8.14 'tbb<2021'
```
4. Activate the newly created environment:
```bash
conda activate qcore-0.8.14-env
```
5. After installation, each user will be asked to read the Software License Agreement to generate a unique token:
```bash
qcore --academic-license
```
